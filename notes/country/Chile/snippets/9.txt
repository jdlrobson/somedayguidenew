Valparaíso funiculars
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso_funiculars
<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> There are 16 extant historical elevators in the city of Valparaíso in Chile.
Technically most of these elevators are bona fide funiculars. Only one of them, the Ascensor Polanco, is a true vertical elevator. They were mainly constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Pikes Peak was rail impossible in the snow

Back in school, we learnt that temperature drops 6°C every 1,000m and a metre is about three feet. Manitou Springs is at an elevation of 6,412ft and Pike Peak's elevation is 14,110ft – that's 7,698ft more. I did some rough calculations in my head 7,500 / 3 = 2,500m. 2.5 x 6°C = 15°C drop

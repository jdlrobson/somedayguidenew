The bubble-blowing creatures of Grenada [I]

On our first evening at the Grenada Love Shack, we heard sharp repetitive “Qui (kee)” calls. The calls became relatively louder, but we were dead tired to investigate. We soon drifted into sleep. The following day, we were occupied by the birds in the neighbourhood until the “Qui Qui Qui” ensemble surfaced in the evening.

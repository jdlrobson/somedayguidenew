Bay of Fundy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Fundy
<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> The Bay of Fundy is a bay between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with a small portion touching the U.S. state of Maine. It is an arm of the Gulf of Maine. Its tidal range is the highest in the world. The name is probably a corruption of the French word fendu, meaning 'split'.

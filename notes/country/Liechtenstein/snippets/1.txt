<small>[Wikipedia]:</from> Vaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein and also the seat of the national parliament. The village, which is located along the Rhine, has 5,696 residents. The most prominent landmark of Vaduz is Vaduz Castle, perched atop a steep hill overlooking the village. It is home to the reigning prince of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein princely family. The village's distinctive architecture is also displayed in landmarks such as the Cathedral of St. Florin, Government House, Village Hall, the National Art Gallery, as well as the National Museum. Although Vaduz is the best-known village in the principality internationally, it is not the largest; neighbouring Schaan has a larger population.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromo_Tengger_Semeru_National_Park
<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park is a national park located in East Java, Indonesia, to the east of Malang and Lumajang, to the south of Pasuruan and Probolinggo, and to the southeast of Surabaya, the capital of East Java. It is the only conservation area in Indonesia that has a sand sea, the Tengger Sand Sea, across which is the caldera of an ancient volcano (Tengger) from which four new volcanic cones have emerged. This unique feature covers a total area of 5,250 hectares at an altitude of about 2,100 meters (6,900Â ft). The massif also contains the highest mountain in Java, Mount Semeru, four lakes and 50 rivers. It is named after the Tenggerese people. The explosion of the volcano that created the caldera, happened ca. 45.000 years ago, in an event similar to the Krakatau eruption.

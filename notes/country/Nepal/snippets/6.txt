Nepalese sculpture
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_sculpture
<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> The sculpture of Nepal is best known for small religious figures and ritual objects in bronze or copper alloy, but also has other strengths. The Newar people of Nepal had a long-lasting specialism in casting small bronze figures, mostly religious and especially Buddhist, considerable numbers of which were exported to India and Tibet over many centuries.

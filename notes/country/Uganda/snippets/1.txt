Lake Bunyonyi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bunyonyi
<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> Lake Bunyonyi  is in south-western Uganda between Kisoro and Kabale, close to the border with Rwanda. The lake appeared from 2004 to 2009 on the USh 5,000/= note under the title "Lake Bunyonyi and terraces". Scientific literature generally quotes a maximum depth of 40 m (130 ft), but some tourist guides and locals insist that it is much deeper, about 900 m (3,000 ft), which would make it the second-deepest lake in Africa.

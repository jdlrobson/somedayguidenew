Grab a boat to the whistling island of Tenerife...One new year I flew into Zaragosa simply because it was cheap and there were trains for not too much to go to **Barcelona**. It turned out to be quite a nice little city. So if you are on a budget, and want to go to Barcelona, consider stopping off at this interesting little city.

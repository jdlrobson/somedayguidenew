<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> South Luangwa National Park is a national park in eastern Zambia that was founded as a game reserve in 1938 and became a national park in 1972. It covers 9,050 km2 (3,490 sq mi) in the valley of the Luangwa River, which forms its eastern boundary in the Eastern Province of Zambia. It is bordered to the west by a steep escarpment, the Muchinga Escarpment in Muchinga and Central Provinces. The Luangwa Valley lies at the end of the East African Rift valley.
The meandering Luangwa River and its lagoons support over 400 bird species and more than 60 mammal species including Rhodesian giraffe, African bush elephant and African buffalo.

<small>[Wikipedia]:</from> Noravank is a 13th-century Armenian monastery, located 122Â km from Yerevan in a narrow gorge made by the Amaghu River, near the town of Yeghegnadzor in Armenia. The gorge is known for its tall, sheer, brick-red cliffs, directly across from the monastery. The monastery is best known for its two-storey Surb Astvatsatsin Church, which grants access to the second floor by way of a narrow stone-made staircase jutting out from the face of building.

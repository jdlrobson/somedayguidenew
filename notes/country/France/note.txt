Lille is for beer and food. Make sure you try something involving Maroille cheese and sample some Mimolette with wine (Linzy's favorite cheese!). There's a lot of Belgian influence around here, while Carbonade flamande is a Belgian dish, it's done very well in Lille.

Someday we'll go and visit the **Jardin botanique d'Ãˆze** a garden perched high above overlooking the Mediterranean sea. The garden pathways will teach us about Eze's artistic heritage.

Roll in on a train from **Belgrade** or head that way (see Linzy's blog post about the fantastic journey). Podgorica is a beautiful mountain town. Note all the taxis run on a meter so no need to haggle on prices. Pod Volat there provides a great introduction to food and drink - just mind the generous portion sizes!

Hallstatt memory
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallstatt
I lost my wallet in Hallstatt. When retracing my steps, the nice lady in the supermarket told me a wallet had been handed in to City Hall by a young child. The lady took me there and all 100+ euros, credit cards and driving license were still in there.

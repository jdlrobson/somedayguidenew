Malaysia offers an ethereal "floating train" experience reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away', with a scenic railway journey across Tasik Bukit Merah in Perak.

Located just a three-hour drive from Kuala Lumpur and easily accessible via the North-South Expressway, Tasik Bukit Merah is one of Malaysia's largest freshwater lakes.

But the real magic happens when you board the train, which runs along the KTM Komuter Northern Sector or KTM ETS lines.

ðŸš† KTM Komuter Northern Sector Line: 10 daily departures and arrivals between Ipoh and Butterworth.
ðŸš† KTM ETS Line: Two departures and arrivals between Gemas and both Butterworth and Padang Besar.

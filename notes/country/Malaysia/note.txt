Head to the riverfront for a good sunset and the call for prayer at the Masjid India Kuching.Some places are just not right for you. This was one of them, however my Dad enjoyed it. I recommend taking the fast boat to the remote Thai island of **Ko Lipe** instead.Take a walk down Jonker street and try the food. We had some incredible Tandorri a little out of town at the Pak Putra Restaurant.

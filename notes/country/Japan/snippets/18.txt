Rakugo
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo
<small>[from en.wikipedia.org]:</small> Rakugo  is a form of Japanese verbal comedy, traditionally performed in yose theatres. The lone storyteller  sits on a raised platform, a kōza (高座). Using only a paper fan  and a small cloth  as props, and without standing up from the seiza sitting position, the rakugo artist depicts a long and complicated comical story. The story always involves the dialogue of two or more characters. The difference between the characters is depicted only through change in pitch, tone, and a slight turn of the head.

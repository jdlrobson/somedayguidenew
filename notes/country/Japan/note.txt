Kyoto was one of the original targets for the nuclear bomb that fell on Hiroshima. Kyoto is a pretty city, lacking many of the high rises of neighbouring Tokyo. Aside from the obvious tourist attractions here I highly advise visiting the deer in **Nara** and from there taking a train ride to the beautiful **Mount Koya** in **Koyasan** with its Buddhist temples and graveyards. Soak in the Dogo Onsen - the inspiration for the Ghibli movie Spirited Away!

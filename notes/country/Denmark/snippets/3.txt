https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_sol
<small>[Wikipedia]:</from> Sort sol is a murmuration, a flocking behavior that occurs in the marshlands in southwestern Jutland, Denmark, in particular the marsh near TÃ¸nder and Ribe. Very large numbers of migratory starlings gather there in spring and autumn when they move between their winter grounds in southern Europe and their summer breeding grounds in Scandinavia and other countries near the Baltic Sea.

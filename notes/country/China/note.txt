I met my Linzy here and she probably would have stayed in **Lijang** forever if it wasn't for love and to be honest I wouldn't have blamed her.

A place you can be very happy.

If you have the good fortune to be here, escape the city.  Head to **Dali** or **Lijang** or **Shangri La** and see the world at its most content.

I went to China and all I got was this lousy panda plate

I went to China on a tour as I had no choice as I had no visa and this was the only way to get in the country from Hong Kong.  I hate tours, and this I think is good justification to why. They wanted Â£10 for a photo of me eating food in a rubbish Chinese restaurant with pandas around me. For all I know the Chinese writing at the top reads "mug". <small>[image from Flickr]</small>

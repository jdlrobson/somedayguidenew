Langbapu Earth Forest [浪巴铺土林] – the beginning of everything

Back in November 2014, there were quite limited options to getting around, we took a long-distance coach from Kunming [昆明] to Yuanmou [元谋] and stayed the night at Xinhua Village [新华乡] that is closest to the earth forest. There is really nothing much to do around here except taking a walk around the nearby village,

Dali Ancient Town [大理古镇]

The cafe owners in the ancient town work extremely hard over the various Chinese public holidays because that's when most Chinese people travel to Dali. With all the income made from these peak seasons, it is enough to cover costs for the entire year. And that's enough for them, anything extra is a bonus.

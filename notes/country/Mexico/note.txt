Cancun is a cheap city to fly into, however if you are adventurous and on a budget consider the 6 hour bus ride down to **Chetumal** for an adventure in **Belize**.  Once in Belize in **Corozal Town**, consider a trip to **Orange Walk Town** if you like bird watching.To get to **Orange Walk Town** take a cab to the ''New market'' where the buses that come to Belize Park and there get on a bus to Orange Walk Town. If itâ€™s about 4 PM get a taxi (you should not pay more than 80.00 Mexican pesos) to the Mexican Border and there wait for a bus to Orange Walk Town. You can also get to **Flores (Guatemala)** from here.

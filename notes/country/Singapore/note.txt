Singapore is Linzy's home and at the current time, we're visiting this city every year! It's a misunderstood city, often because of brief encounters for logistic reasons on route to places like Australia, however the food is incredible (and cheap if you look in the right place!) and nature exists in Jon's favorite place **Pulau Ubin**. It has it all and is the perfect introduction to Asia for the westerner.

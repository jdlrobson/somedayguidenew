Come to Bergen for access to the fjords. Seeing the northern lights, or the aurora borealis, as they are also known, is a jaw-dropping and mystical moment. Perhaps here given the remoteness you will see them clearly (I didn't have much luck in **Reykjav√≠k**). The lights are at their most frequent in late autumn and winter/early spring.
